The Graphical Processing Unit (GPU) is a powerful component for parallel programs and graphic rendering.
It is possible to use it in the browser through WebGL and WebGPU.

Here is a list of projects that uses this system:

* https://threejs.org/
  JavaScript 3D library, with examples
  (https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/)

* http://stack.gl/
  open software ecosystem for WebGL

* https://github.com/Erkaman/regl-cnn
  Digit recognition with Convolutional Neural Networks in WebGL
  (https://erkaman.github.io/regl-cnn/src/demo.html)

* https://github.com/stackgl/shader-school
  A workshopper for GLSL shaders and graphics programming

* https://github.com/glslify/glslify
